# tn3270-server

A TN3270 server written in TypeScript. Inspired by [go3270 (A Go 3270 Server implementation by Matthew R. Wilson)](https://github.com/racingmars/go3270/).

The goal of this project is a lot simpler than the original with the goal of making a MVP implementation of a TN3270 server. Abstractions are left to your discretion. I will get to making my own abstractions later in a separate project.
